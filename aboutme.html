Assalamualaikum, 
introduce my name Nur Aliya Imani Binti Hassan.
I was born on 08/12/2000 at 7.15 a.m.
At Kuala Lumpur Hospital in Kuala Lumpur. 
I am a Muslim and was born into an Islamic family.
I am a graduate of <abbr title="Sekolah Kebangsaan Puchong Indah">SKPI</abbr> and <abbr title="Sekolah Menengah Kebangsaan Puchong Perdana">SMKPP</abbr>. 
Now, I am a student from the <abbr title="University Technology Mara">UiTM Kedah Branch</abbr>.
I have a happy family. I am so thankful to God that my life is complete.
The presence of a man named father, mother and sister make up my family. 
Dad and mom are the people I love and respect the most in my life.
Although I failed at their command and made mistakes, they still loved me and advised me 
My family always hoped for the best for me.
I also have only one sister.
The presence of loving family members has blessed my life since birth and now. 
I grew up receiving an undying love for my family members who always supported my actions.
My favorite subject is Geography , History, Islamic Studies and Science. 
I am an ambitious person. I am an ordinary girl who aspires to be a librarian or lecturer one day.

In my spare time, I enjoy reading books. 
Among my favorite reading materials are novels, magazines, and fiction books.
In addition, I enjoy browsing the internet and reading to gather information on professional careers that I may pursue. 
I want to know more about a career before exploring it so that I can make decisions based on my interests.
In addition, I am a confident person and stand firm. I always want to do my best in all the jobs and assignments I receive. 
Prayer is also a factor in my success. Every effort made must be accompanied by prayer and a high commitment.
I like doing my tasks systematically. Therefore, I will go about my daily activities based on the daily schedule I have prepared. 
It also helps me manage my time wisely because I always know what to do at certain times. 
Therefore, I can avoid wasting time. In addition, good time management is very important to me as a student.
